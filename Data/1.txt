      Avoid dust formation. Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal. Dispose of contents/container in
      accordance with local/regional/national/international regulations.
      Environmental Precautions
      Avoid dust formation. Ventilate affected area. Discharge into the environment must be avoided.
      Section 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
      Precautions for Safe Handling
      Use methods to minimize dust. Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Avoid breathing
      dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Routine housekeeping should be
      instituted to ensure that dusts do not accumulate on surfaces.

      There are no biological limit values for any of this product's components.
      Engineering Controls
      Provide local exhaust ventilation system. Ensure compliance with applicable exposure limits. Ensure that dust-
      handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a
      manner to prevent the escape of dust into the work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment).
      Individual Protection Measures, such as Personal Protective Equipment
      Eye/face protection
      Wear splash resistant safety goggles. Provide an emergency eye wash fountain and quick drench shower in the
      immediate work area.
      Skin Protection
      Wear appropriate chemical resistant clothing.
      Respiratory Protection
      Under conditions of frequent use or heavy exposure, respiratory protection may be needed. Respiratory protection is
      ranked in order from minimum to maximum. Consider warning properties before use. Any air-purifying half-mask
      respirator equipped with organic vapor cartridge(s) in combination with an N95, R95, or P95 filter. The following
      filters may also be used: N99, R99, P99, N100, R100 or P100. Any air-purifying full-facepiece respirator (gas mask)
      with a chin-style, front-mounted or back-mounted organic vapor canister. Any powered, air-purifying respirator with
      a tight-fitting facepiece, organic vapor cartridge(s) and high-efficiency particulate filter(s). Any supplied-air
      respirator with a full facepiece that is operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode. For Unknown
      Concentrations or Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health -. Any supplied-air respirator with a full facepiece that
      is operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode in combination with an auxiliary self-contained
      breathing apparatus operated in pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode. Any self-contained breathing
      apparatus that has a full facepiece and is operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode.
      Glove Recommendations
      Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves.
